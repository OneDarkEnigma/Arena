# About Me

Hi all, I'm 'OneDarkEnigma'.

My passion is in video games, currently working on various tinker projects. Learning Linux atm and specifically i3. How some of you guys have this as your main platform of choice is beyond me; there again I am only at the very start of this journey. 

Looking to learn a lot, so if you end up here through a stupid question I've asked on a thread; you know why.

Ciao XD
